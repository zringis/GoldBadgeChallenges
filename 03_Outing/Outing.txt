﻿Komodo Outings

Komodo accountants need a list of all outings, the cost of all outings combined, and the 
cost of all types of outings combined. 

Here are the parts of an outing:

	Event Type:
		Golf, Bowling, Amusement Park, Concert
	Number of people that attended,
	Date,
	Total cost per person for the event,
	Total cost for the event

Here's what they'd like:
1. Display a list of all outings.
2. Add individual outings to a list(don't need to worry about delete yet)
3. Calculations: 
	They'd like to see a display for the combined cost for all outings.
	They'd like to see a display of outing costs by type.
		For example, all bowling outings for the year were $2000.00.
		All Concert outings cost $5000.00.
